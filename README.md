# Locality Sensitive Hashing repo by Tim Hearn

- Please read slide deck in 'slides' for more detailed information.  Email me at timhearn99@gmail.com if you have any questions or a follow up.  Read the google colab notebook first as it contains the majority of the work.
- Note:  It is far simpler to read the google colab notebook if you open it in google colab.  I would strongly recommend the slides first, then the google colab notebook, then the rest of the github repo, which you may find unnecessary after you do the first 2.
